## Adopters list (alphabetical)

* [Getup](https://getup.io) - Getup is the original author of CEL Playground, we use the playground with our customers to help them learn how to make use of CEL within Kubernetes
* [Ifood](https://www.ifood.com.br/) - Cel Playground helps me a lot in my CEL expression studies and is a valuable partner when it comes to important implementations in quick tests and immediate feedback, in addition to being able to simulate real scenarios. I love this tool.
* [LINUXtips](https://linuxtips.io) - LINUXtips effectively utilizes CEL Playground to support students in grasping the implementation of security policies using CEL. This valuable resource enables students to actively test and apply what they are learning in a practical way, helping them gain a deeper understanding of real-world applications.
* [Lucas Käldström](https://github.com/luxas) - CEL playground helps me debug my CEL expressions for usage with Kubernetes; I've used it for e.g. Kubernetes' structured authentication/authorization configuration and ValidatingAdmissionPolicy. I like the simplicity and the fact I can use it directly from the browser.
